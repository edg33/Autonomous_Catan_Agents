# Reinforcement Learning Final Project
This project attempts to teach an autonomous agent the board game Settlers of Catan. It had limited success due to computational limitations.
Improvements may be made to the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and its treatment of the game state. 

The environment of the game is properly implemented such that the game may be played in the terminal with some modifications.

Refer to the write-up for a more comprehensive discussion.
